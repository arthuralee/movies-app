## Requirements

- Port 4000 is free for the server
- Port 3000 is free for frontend development
  (though react-scripts will find an alternative free port)
- Tested with node 13.8, but will likely work in other versions

## Instructions

1. Clone the repo/download the source
2. run `yarn` or `npm install`
3. Start the server by running `yarn run start-server` or `npm start-server`
4. Start the frontend dev server by running `yarn start` or `npm start`
5. Visit the address from the output of the previous step (normally http://localhost:3000)
